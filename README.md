Welcome to my GitHub project - the Snake Game, a recreation of the classic game that we all remember playing on our old keypad mobile phones.

This project aims to bring back the nostalgia and memories of simpler times when mobile phones were not as advanced as they are today. The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game that requires you to guide a snake around a field, eating apples to grow longer. However, you must be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body, or else it's game over.
This version of the Snake Game is built using python It features smooth and responsive controls, retro-style graphics, and challenging gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours.

Whether you're a fan of the original Snake Game or simply looking for a fun and nostalgic gaming experience, this project is for you. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, and relive those old memories of playing Snake on your trusty keypad mobile phone.
